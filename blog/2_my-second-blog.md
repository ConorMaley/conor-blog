Jeff Bezos said that business is like baseball without a constraint on the number of runs earned by a home run. In baseball the max is 4, in business the max can be over 1000. 

## What if home runs were worth 2 runs?
Parameters
- MLB Rules, except for the following caveats
- The batter who hits a home run runs twice around the bases, scoring twice.
    - Any runner already on base will continue to score once

### What's the added value? (How boring does this make the game)?
### How much more time does it add to the game?
How long does it take for the average player to run the bases?
